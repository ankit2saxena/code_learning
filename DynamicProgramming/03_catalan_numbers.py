'''
Catalan numbers are a sequence of natural numbers that occurs in many interesting counting problems like following.
1) Count the number of expressions containing n pairs of parentheses which are correctly matched. For n = 3, possible expressions are ((())), ()(()), ()()(), (())(), (()()).
2) Count the number of possible Binary Search Trees with n keys.
3) Count the number of full binary trees (A rooted binary tree is full if every vertex has either two children or no children) with n+1 leaves.

The first few Catalan numbers for n = 0, 1, 2, 3, â€¦ are 1, 1, 2, 5, 14, 42, 132, 429, 1430, 4862, ...
